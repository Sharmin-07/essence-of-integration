Understanding the working of integration through intuitive derivation and conceptual reconstruction.

# About Me:-
I'm Sharmin Nabab.
I'm currently a high school student.
My interests span mathematics and physics. I also enjoy coding and am currently learning Python.
I like to break down concepts and rebuild ideas as if explaining to my younger self, often through a first-principles approach.
This space serves as a notebook for my reconstructions and explorations of ideas.
