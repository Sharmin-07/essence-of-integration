WHY I DID THIS
(This is more like a personal account and reflects my own experience — read only if you’re interested.)

When my teacher first presented this proof in class to explain the working of calculus, he said that we could slice the circle into infinitely many concentric rings. He further explained that when we “unwrap” a ring
into a strip, we can consider that strip to be rectangular, since the error is infinitely small. Then we find the area of this “rectangular” strip and integrate the area of all these strips with suitable limits, 
and we get πr².

I was aware that integrating essentially means adding up infinitely small numbers, and I wondered that if we had not approximated the strip to be a rectangle and had included it in the integration as it is, it
should also amount to some value. When I confronted my teacher about this, he said that it was because the approximation removes the area of the strip which is of the order of (dr)², 
and since (dr)² vanishes faster than dr, we neglect it.

This didn’t clear things up as much as it made me feel like we were approximating in mathematics, which made me question why calculus is so revered if it is approximation at its core.
So, I did some independent studying and was able to conclude that this all revolves around the essence of integration and how cleverly the inventors of calculus thought. Basically, we use the idea of approximating
the value of a quantity or variable with respect to the hyperreal world, which corresponds to its exact value in the real world.
